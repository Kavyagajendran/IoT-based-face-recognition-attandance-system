## Project Description

The **IoT-Based Face Recognition Attendance System** is an automated attendance management solution that uses **computer vision** and **IoT technologies** to identify individuals through facial recognition and record attendance in real time.  
The system eliminates manual attendance processes, reduces human error, and ensures secure and accurate identification.

A camera captures live video frames, which are processed using face detection and recognition algorithms. Once a registered face is recognized, attendance is marked automatically and stored digitally. The IoT architecture enables centralized data storage and remote monitoring.

This project demonstrates the practical integration of **AI-powered vision**, **embedded systems**, and **networked data management**.
